# Overview
It is not a secret that software projects became less and less managable as development continues. Every change increases entropy and increases technical debt if these qualities are not managed directly. While industry dedicates terms and processes to describe the state of the software implementation, it does not point to oblivious root cause. This cause should be treated with excessive care and kindness, as it is very sensitive in nature. People, and namelly software engineers make changes which increase complexity of the software.

Together and whoever is concerned we all should understand the reasoning, motivation and fear behind actions which slowly and surely kills projects.

This site address to people: software engineers, managers, family and friends to help to uncover best practises. It should support engineers in need to overcome time pressure, unreasonable demand for features, learning paralysis and covered incompetence. 




# The definition 

> "Complex code" is an expression of a state of mind of a software engineer towards source code of a codebase in a given timeframe.

# The software engineer
A person, who poses expertise and skill to modify data and instractions for a computer to operate.

# The codebase
Collection of a source code that is used to build software system, application or a component.
Source code is a human-readable set of instructions. Codebase might also include data which would became part of the whole application or can support application development in any other way.

# The state of mind
Software engineers, as all people, think and feel every moment they do something. 

# The time frame 
For simplisity, let's use current moment as reference point in time, e.g. now.

# The expression
